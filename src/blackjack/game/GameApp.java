		 * 4. Dealer deals 1 card to himself
		 * 5. Dealer deal 1 card to player
		 * 6. Dealer deals 1 card to himself and face up
		 * 7. Player decide to hit or stand (double down, split and surrender are not included in this project)
		 * 8. After player stand, dealer deals card to himself if his total hand value is less than 17
		 * 9. When dealer stand, compare hand values
		 * 
		 * 	How do you beat the dealer?

				By drawing a hand value that is higher than the dealerâ€™s hand value
				By the dealer drawing a hand value that goes over 21.
				By drawing a hand value of 21 on your first two cards, when the dealer does not.
			
			How do you lose to the dealer? 
			
				Your hand value exceeds 21.
				The dealers hand has a greater value than yours at the end of the round
				
			10. loser pays wager to winner.
